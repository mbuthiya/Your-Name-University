Software engineering is bigger that app you built in your class. There are stacks
ques Big o(my God what is that) I dont know what the hell those things are but well thats why I started this to LEARN.


This is inspired but from [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)

This is will be a checklist of things I will be learning as I go along. I will write a blog weekly
just to document my progress. The list will expand as I continue to learn new concepts.

## Month 1: Initiation.

This is the make and break month it either I give up and delete this repo with shame :(.
Or I actually pull through and learn something.

- [ ] Learn C programming

* C is everwhere (apparently) I always thought I could avoid it but here we go (ツ)_/¯
